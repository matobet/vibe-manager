## Data Model

### Storage Structure
```
workspace/
├── .vibe-manager              # Workspace config (YAML)
├── report-slug/
│   ├── _profile.md            # Report profile (YAML frontmatter)
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD.md          # Legacy meeting format (still supported at root)
│   ├── journal/               # New journal entries stored here
│   │   └── YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.md  # Journal entry (meeting or mood observation)
│   └── team/                  # For managers: their direct reports
│       └── team-member-slug/
│           ├── _profile.md    # 2nd-level report profile
│           └── journal/       # Skip-level meeting notes

# 1-on-1 Meeting Best Practices for Engineering Managers

## Overview: Why 1-on-1s Matter

One-on-one meetings are the cornerstone of effective engineering management. They represent your most powerful tool for building trust, driving engagement, and supporting your team's growth. Unlike status updates or team meetings, 1-on-1s create a dedicated space for the conversations that matter most: career development, feedback exchange, and addressing concerns before they escalate.

### The Business Case

The data on 1-on-1 effectiveness is compelling:

- **Engagement Impact**: On average, only 15% of employees who work for a manager who does not meet with them regularly are engaged. Managers who regularly meet with their employees almost triple that level of engagement to approximately 45% [1].

- **Disengagement Prevention**: Employees who get twice the number of one-on-ones with their manager relative to their peers are 67% less likely to be disengaged [2].

- **Manager Performance**: Google's Project Oxygen research shows that managers who have frequent 1:1 meetings with their reports tend to score higher in performance than managers who don't have these check-ins [3].

- **Retention Risk**: When a manager doesn't meet with employees one-on-one at all, employees are four times as likely to be disengaged [1].

For engineering managers specifically, 1-on-1s serve a unique purpose. There are plenty of ways to get work status (standups, Jira, sprint reviews, demos), so your 1-on-1 is not the place for project updates. This meeting is for information you cannot get any other way: insights into blockers, career aspirations, interpersonal dynamics, and early warning signs of burnout or disengagement [4].

## Recommended Frequency

### General Guideline: Weekly to Bi-Weekly, 30-60 Minutes

Consistency is key to effective one-on-ones. Most experts recommend holding 1:1s at least bi-weekly or, ideally, once a week [5]. According to a poll of engineering managers, the majority conduct one-on-ones bi-weekly [6].

**Duration considerations:**
- **30 minutes**: Minimum viable time; works for established relationships with high-performing senior engineers
- **45-60 minutes**: Often considered the sweet spot for meaningful conversations
- Shorter meetings tend to get consumed by surface-level updates; more personal or difficult topics typically emerge around the 20-30 minute mark [5]

### Adapting for Junior and New Engineers

Junior engineers and new hires require more frequent touchpoints:

| Timeframe | Recommended Frequency | Focus Areas |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| First 2 weeks | Daily brief check-ins | Orientation, immediate questions, psychological safety |
| Weeks 3-8 | Weekly (45-60 min) | Onboarding progress, technical ramp-up, cultural integration |
| Months 3-6 | Weekly (30-45 min) | Skill development, increasing autonomy, early career planning |
| After 6 months | Weekly to bi-weekly | Transition to standard cadence based on performance |

Key considerations for junior engineers:
- Pair them with senior engineers for additional mentorship touchpoints [7]
- Use weekly 1-on-1s to generate continuous feedback throughout onboarding [8]
- Monitor for signs they need more support (hesitation to ask questions, consistent blockers, visible stress)

### Adapting for Senior and High-Performing Engineers

Senior engineers often benefit from a different cadence:

- A tenured high-performer might feel micromanaged by weekly meetings [6]
- Monthly one-on-ones can work well for senior-level employees who prefer independence within their roles [9]
- Worker autonomy is a key factor in determining appropriate frequency [6]

**Best practice**: Rather than assuming, ask directly: "How do you feel about doing an hour every other week instead of 30 minutes weekly?" Giving them a say in the cadence immediately increases their ownership of the time [6].

**Signs a senior engineer may need more frequent check-ins:**
- Taking on a new technical leadership role
- Working on high-stakes or ambiguous projects
- Showing signs of frustration or burnout
- Navigating interpersonal challenges

## Key Frameworks

### Manager Tools 10/10/10 Format

The 10/10/10 format, developed by Manager Tools, provides a simple structure for 30-minute weekly one-on-ones [10]:

| Segment | Time | Owner | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| **First 10 minutes** | 10 min | Direct Report | Their agenda - anything they want to discuss: work, challenges, career, personal life |
| **Second 10 minutes** | 10 min | Manager | Your agenda - guidance, coaching, feedback, context sharing |
| **Third 10 minutes** | 10 min | Shared | The future - career development, training, growth opportunities |

**Practical reality**: In practice, the direct often takes 15 minutes, and the manager will too, meaning the future-focused segment gets skipped. That's acceptable when both parties have covered what they need [10]. The key insight is that the third segment creates dedicated time for the career discussions managers often say they never have time for.

**Key principles**:
- The primary focus of the One-On-One is on the direct report [10]
- Taking notes is important because what your people say matters [10]
- Never cancel a 1:1 - missing it sends a powerful message that the relationship isn't important [10]

### GROW Coaching Model

The GROW Model, developed in the 1980s by Graham Alexander, Alan Fine, and Sir John Whitmore, is a coaching framework ideal for goal-oriented discussions and problem-solving conversations [11].

**G - Goal**
- Establish what the employee wants to achieve
- Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound)
- Ask: "What do you really want?" or "What do you hope to get out of your time in this role?"

**R - Reality**
- Examine the current situation honestly
- Identify starting points, gaps, and available resources
- Often reveals solutions naturally as team members describe their present situation
- Ask: "Where are you now in relation to your goal?" or "What have you tried so far?"

**O - Options**
- Brainstorm multiple potential paths forward
- Guide team members while letting them lead the conversation
- Ask open-ended questions to explore advantages and obstacles
- Ask: "What options do you have?" or "What else could you do?"

**W - Will (or Way Forward)**
- Secure specific action commitments with timelines
- Establish accountability mechanisms
- Schedule progress reviews
- Ask: "What will you do by when?" or "What support do you need?"

**Important note**: The components of GROW do not necessarily follow a strict sequence. Effective coaching conversations typically start with Goal and Reality, then move between all four elements as needed [11].

### Radical Candor Approach

Radical Candor, developed by Kim Scott based on her experience at Google and Apple, provides a framework for feedback that is both caring and direct [12].

**The Core Concept**: Radical Candor happens when you simultaneously Care Personally and Challenge Directly [12].

**The Four Quadrants:**

```
                    Challenge Directly
                           |
    Obnoxious          |        Radical
    Aggression         |        Candor
                       |
  ---------------------|---------------------
                       |
    Manipulative       |        Ruinous
    Insincerity        |        Empathy
                       |
                  Care Personally
```

| Quadrant | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Radical Candor** | High care + High challenge | "I can see you're capable of more than this. Here's specific feedback on what needs to improve..." |
| **Ruinous Empathy** | High care + Low challenge | Sugarcoating feedback or avoiding it entirely to spare feelings; most common mistake [12] |
| **Obnoxious Aggression** | Low care + High challenge | Brutal honesty without concern for the person; "front-stabbing" [12] |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** | Low care + Low challenge | Feedback designed for personal gain rather than helping; political behavior [12] |

**Application in 1-on-1s**:
1. First, build a relationship so they know you care personally about them and their career
2. Then, be extremely candid and clear with critical feedback
3. Leave no room for interpretation
4. Practice the order of operations: solicit feedback, offer specific praise, give kind but clear criticism [12]

## Research Findings

### Gallup Research on Employee Engagement

Gallup's extensive organizational research provides the most compelling evidence for 1-on-1 effectiveness:

- Employees who have regular one-on-one meetings with their manager are almost **three times as likely to be engaged** as those who don't [1]
- Employees who receive daily feedback from their manager are **3x more likely to be engaged** than those who receive feedback once a year or less [1]
- At least **70% of the variance in team engagement** is explained by the quality of the manager or team leader [1]
- Engagement levels among Millennials (the least engaged generation at 29%) rise significantly when their manager holds regular meetings with them [1]

### Microsoft Research on Meeting Effectiveness

Microsoft's Work Trend Index and internal research reveal important context about meeting culture:

- Since February 2020, people are in **3 times more meetings** per week, a 192% increase [13]
- **57% of the average employee's time** is spent in meetings, email, and chat [13]
- **68% of workers** don't have enough uninterrupted focus time [13]
- About **42% of meeting attendees** multitask by sending messages during meetings [13]

**Implications for 1-on-1s**: In an environment of meeting overload, 1-on-1s must be protected time that delivers clear value. They should not add to the problem of meeting fatigue but rather serve as an antidote - a dedicated space for the conversations that actually matter.

**Microsoft research also found**:
- Studies show a **78% reduction in meeting volume** and **22% increase in focused work** on meeting-free days [13]
- The lack of a break between meetings in itself can be exhausting [14]

### Academic Research on Manager-Employee Relationships

Academic literature consistently demonstrates the critical importance of manager-employee relationship quality:

- **Social Exchange Theory (SET)** provides the lens for understanding the manager-employee relationship as an exchange process involving reciprocity [15]
- The perception of a high-quality relationship with the manager **increases engagement** as the employee feels appreciated and valued, encouraging them to invest more time, find ways to improve tasks, and increase efficiency [15]
- **Positive employer-employee relationships significantly enhance job satisfaction and employee performance** [16]
- **Engaged employees are 20% more productive** than their counterparts and become advocates for their organizations [15]
- Research using Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory shows that the quality of the manager-subordinate relationship significantly impacts work outcomes [15]
- The **Marcus Buckingham Company** found that engagement improved by **57%** when team leaders checked in with team members frequently [17]

## Best Practices

### 1. Make It Employee-Driven

The employee - not you - should set the agenda. This is probably the most misunderstood aspect of 1-on-1s [18].

**Implementation**:
- Have employees share talking points before the meeting
- Allow the employee to guide the conversation in the direction they want [19]
- As VP of People at Reddit Katelin Holloway notes, sharing talking points in advance "allows the employee to guide the conversation in the way that they want" [19]
- Building the agenda together reduces anxiety and increases employee buy-in [3]

**Benefits**:
- Employees feel ownership over their own performance
- Reduces manager blind spots
- Surfaces issues the manager might not have known about

### 2. Maintain Consistent Scheduling

Consistency matters more than duration. As one management expert notes, it's "less about the actual minutes and more about the consistency" [20].

**Best practices**:
- Block recurring calendar time and protect it fiercely
- If rescheduling is necessary, do so immediately rather than canceling
- Maintain the same time slot each week when possible to create a predictable rhythm
- Organizations where 55% of highly engaged employees have monthly or quarterly 1-on-1s compared to only 22% of disengaged organizations [3]

### 3. Practice Active Listening

Try to get your direct report to do **70% of the talking** [5]. Keep "the thought bubble over their head" for as much of the meeting as possible.

**Techniques**:
- Ask open-ended questions, then wait
- Resist the urge to immediately solve problems
- Reflect back what you've heard to confirm understanding
- Take notes to show their input matters and to aid follow-up
- Pay attention to what's not being said

### 4. Follow Up on Action Items

After a one-on-one meeting, send a summary outlining key takeaways, decisions made, and action items assigned to each party [4].

**Accountability framework**:
- Document commitments made by both parties
- Review previous action items at the start of each meeting
- Track patterns over time (recurring blockers, growth areas)
- Use a shared document or tool for transparency

### 5. Start with Connection, Not Business

Before diving into agenda items, take a few minutes to connect on a human level [5]. Ask about their weekend, follow up on something they mentioned previously, discuss non-work topics.

This builds the relationship foundation that makes difficult conversations possible.

### 6. Create Psychological Safety

The meeting should feel like a safe space for honest conversation:
- Don't take calls or check messages during the meeting [20]
- Consider walking meetings or informal settings occasionally [21]
- A group of Stanford researchers found that people's ability to think creatively increases by an average of 60% when walking [21]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Using 1-on-1s as Status Update Meetings

**The mistake**: Treating 1-on-1s as project progress reports or growth chart discussions [18].

**Why it's harmful**: Status can be communicated via email, standups, or project management tools. Using precious 1-on-1 time for status deprives both parties of the relationship-building and development conversations that create lasting value.

**The fix**: Have a "lightweight agenda" that is "being driven ideally by the employee or in concert with the manager" [20].

### 2. Frequently Canceling Meetings

**The mistake**: Treating 1-on-1s as optional time that can be reclaimed when busy.

**Why it's harmful**: When managers frequently cancel meetings with direct reports, it inadvertently signals that they're not valued [20]. You might earn an extra 30 minutes, but you'll actually be doing a disservice to yourself and your team [18].

**The fix**: Apart from sick days, vacations, and emergencies, never cancel your one-on-one meetings [18]. If you must reschedule, do so immediately and explain why.

### 3. Dominating the Conversation

**The mistake**: Using the meeting to delegate projects, defend decisions, or advocate for your vision [18].

**Why it's harmful**: Your motive should be to figure out where your direct report is, not to push your agenda. The meeting loses its purpose if it becomes a one-way broadcast.

**The fix**: Aim for a 70/30 split where your direct report does most of the talking [5].

### 4. Coming Unprepared

**The mistake**: Showing up without topics, questions, or review of previous discussions.

**Why it's harmful**: According to research, 36% of employees believe their manager is only "slightly prepared," while 40% believe their manager is "not prepared at all" [21]. Without a clear agenda, meetings become awkward silence or meaningless conversations [21].

**The fix**: Review notes from last meeting, prepare 2-3 questions, and think about any feedback or context to share.

### 5. Being Distracted During the Meeting

**The mistake**: Taking calls, checking messages, or visibly watching a second screen.

**Why it's harmful**: Communicates that there are other people and issues more important than this person [20].

**The fix**: If there is a crisis, reschedule the meeting entirely rather than "limping through" with limited attention [20].

### 6. Rushing Through Meetings

**The mistake**: Continuously looking at the watch, appearing anxious to move to the next meeting.

**Why it's harmful**: As Andy Grove noted, "The subordinate must feel that there is enough time to broach and get into thorny issues" [21].

**The fix**: Dedicate enough time and allow for long, meaningful discussions. If you're genuinely pressed for time, shorten the meeting properly rather than rushing.

### 7. Focusing Only on Negatives

**The mistake**: Spending the entire conversation addressing mistakes or challenges.

**Why it's harmful**: Can demotivate employees and create anxiety around future meetings. In a study of over 2,500 managers and 13,000 direct reports, managers who were worst at balancing employee needs with results had **three to four times more quiet quitters** on their team [21].

**The fix**: Start with wins - acknowledge recent achievements or efforts. Balance constructive criticism with recognition of strengths and successes.

### 8. Micromanaging Through 1-on-1s

**The mistake**: Using the meeting to monitor work in detail, second-guess decisions, or control how tasks are completed.

**Why it's harmful**: Breaks trust and limits performance. If an engineer frequently seems anxious or defensive when talking about their work, consider whether you might be micromanaging unintentionally [4].

**The fix**: Use 1-on-1 meetings to validate autonomy, not to exercise control [6]. Agree on what success looks like and let the engineer figure out how to get there.

                    │   VP/Director   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
           ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
           │                 │                 │
    ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌──────┴──────┐
    │  Principal  │   │   Sr. EM    │   │  Architect  │
    │  Engineer   │   │             │   │             │
    └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘
           │                 │                 │
    ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌──────┴──────┐          │
    │    Staff    │   │     EM      │          │
    │   Engineer  │   │             │          │
    └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘          │
           │                 │                 │
           └─────────────────┼─────────────────┘

## 5. Progress Tracking Methods

### OKRs for Development Goals

Use the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework for career development:

**Example: Growth OKRs for Q1**

```markdown
## Objective: Grow system design skills to Senior level

### Key Results:
1. Lead design for 2 medium-complexity features
   - Progress: 1/2 completed
   - Evidence: Payment caching design (shipped)

2. Get "meets bar" feedback from Staff+ reviewer on design doc
   - Progress: Achieved
   - Evidence: Alex's review on caching design

3. Complete system design interview prep (12 problems)
   - Progress: 8/12 completed

## Objective: Develop technical leadership capabilities

### Key Results:
1. Mentor 1 junior engineer through their first project
   - Progress: In progress (Sarah's onboarding project)

2. Present at 2 team knowledge-sharing sessions
   - Progress: 1/2 completed
   - Evidence: "Intro to Caching Patterns" (Jan 15)

3. Receive positive feedback from 3 cross-team collaborators
   - Progress: 2/3 collected
```

**Tips for Development OKRs:**
- Keep them separate from performance OKRs
- Focus on 2-3 objectives per quarter
- Make key results measurable and evidence-based
- Review monthly, not just quarterly

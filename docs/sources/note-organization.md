# Best Practices for 1-on-1 Note Management

A research document on effective systems and approaches for managing notes from one-on-one meetings.

---

## 1. Overview

### Why Take 1-on-1 Notes

One-on-one meetings are the cornerstone of effective engineering management. They provide dedicated time for career development conversations, feedback exchange, problem-solving, and relationship building. However, without proper documentation, the insights and commitments from these conversations can easily be lost.

Notes serve multiple purposes:

- **Memory aid**: Even with the best intentions, details fade. Notes preserve the nuances of discussions that matter.
- **Commitment tracking**: When you say "I'll look into that promotion timeline," a note ensures you actually do.
- **Pattern detection**: Individual conversations may seem routine, but patterns emerge when you can review months of discussions.
- **Growth evidence**: During performance reviews, concrete examples from notes are far more valuable than vague recollections.

### How to Take Notes

The mechanics of note-taking during 1-on-1s require balance. Taking notes should not interfere with the conversation or make the other person feel like they're being interrogated.

**During the meeting:**
- Jot down key points, not transcripts
- Focus on action items, decisions, and significant statements
- Use shorthand you can expand later
- Consider taking notes openly on paper or a shared screen when appropriate

**Immediately after:**
- Spend 2-5 minutes expanding abbreviated notes
- Capture context that seemed obvious in the moment
- Highlight action items for yourself
- Note emotional tone or concerns that may need follow-up

## 2. Benefits of Good Note-Taking

### Continuity Between Meetings

Without notes, each 1-on-1 starts from scratch. With notes, you can:

```markdown
## Last Meeting Follow-up
- Discussed Sarah's interest in tech lead role
- She was working on the API redesign proposal
- Had concerns about workload during Q4 planning

## This Week
- Check in on API proposal progress
- Discuss Q4 planning timeline announcement
- Revisit tech lead conversation if appropriate
```

This continuity shows your direct reports that you remember and care about what they share.

### Pattern Recognition Over Time

Individual data points become meaningful when viewed together:

| Date | Topic | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Jan 15 | Workload | "Feeling stretched thin" |
| Feb 1 | Project X | "Taking longer than expected" |
| Feb 15 | Team dynamics | "Picking up slack for others" |
| Mar 1 | Career | "Not sure I'm growing" |

Reviewing these entries reveals a pattern: this engineer may be overloaded and losing motivation. A single conversation might not have surfaced this trend.

### Accountability for Follow-ups

The most damaging thing a manager can do is repeatedly fail to follow through. Notes create accountability:

```markdown
## Action Items (Manager)
- [ ] Talk to HR about training budget for Python course
- [ ] Schedule skip-level with VP about promotion criteria
- [ ] Share link to technical writing resources

## Action Items (Engineer)
- [ ] Draft proposal for new testing framework
- [ ] Set up meeting with design team
```

When you review notes before each 1-on-1, these items become your agenda.

### Preparation for Reviews

Performance review season is stressful enough without trying to recall six months of conversations. Well-maintained notes provide:

- Specific examples of achievements and growth
- Context for challenges and how they were addressed
- Evidence of skill development
- Record of feedback given and received
- Documentation of goals set and progress made

```markdown
## Review Evidence (Q3)
- Led migration project (completed Aug 15, under budget)
- Mentored two junior engineers on testing practices
- Gave presentation at team tech talk (Sept 3)
- Struggled with cross-team communication initially, improved significantly after coaching
```

---

## 3. Note Structure Approaches

### Free-form vs Structured

**Free-form notes** work well for:
- Managers who think in narratives
- Highly variable conversation topics
- Building rapport where structure feels clinical

Example free-form entry:
```markdown
## 2024-03-15 - Alex

Good energy today. We spent most of the time talking about the database
migration project. Alex is nervous about the timeline but has a solid plan.
Mentioned wanting to present at the all-hands - I should follow up on this.
Also briefly discussed the new PTO policy; seems fine with it.
```

**Structured notes** work well for:
- Ensuring consistency across direct reports
- Making information easy to find later
- Managers who prefer checklists and templates

Example structured entry:
```markdown
## 2024-03-15 - Alex

### Wins
- Completed initial database schema design
- Received positive feedback from stakeholders

### Challenges
- Timeline concerns for Q2 delivery
- Waiting on infrastructure team for test environment

### Action Items
- [Manager] Find all-hands presentation slot
- [Alex] Draft migration runbook by March 22

### Career/Growth
- Interest in presenting technical work to broader audience

### Personal
- Taking Friday off for family event
```

### Common Templates

**The WWW Template (Wins, Worries, Wants)**
```markdown
## Wins
What's going well? Recent accomplishments?

## Worries
What's concerning them? Blockers or frustrations?

## Wants
What do they need from you? Career aspirations?
```

**The 4Ps Template (Progress, Problems, Plans, Personal)**
```markdown
## Progress
What have they accomplished since last meeting?

## Problems
What obstacles are they facing?

## Plans
What are they working on next?

## Personal
How are they doing as a person?
```

**The Action-Oriented Template**
```markdown
## Review Previous Actions
Status of items from last meeting

## Discussion Topics
Main conversation points

## New Actions
Commitments made this meeting

## Notes for Next Time
Things to remember or follow up on
```

### Topic-based Organization

For longer-term tracking, consider organizing by topic rather than just date:

```markdown
# Alex - 1-on-1 Notes

## Career Development
- 2024-01: Discussed interest in architecture role
- 2024-03: Created development plan for system design skills
- 2024-06: Completed AWS certification

## Project: Database Migration
- 2024-02-15: Kicked off planning
- 2024-03-01: Timeline concerns raised
- 2024-04-15: Successfully launched

## Feedback Given
- 2024-02: Communication in code reviews (improve)
- 2024-04: Mentoring junior engineers (strength)
```

---

## 4. Privacy and Ethics

### What to Document vs What Not To

**Document:**
- Professional goals and aspirations
- Project updates and challenges
- Feedback given and received
- Action items and commitments
- Skills development discussions
- General well-being check-ins (at a high level)

**Avoid documenting:**
- Specific medical information beyond what affects work
- Details of personal relationships or family situations
- Gossip or complaints about colleagues (document patterns, not specifics)
- Speculation about others' performance or behavior
- Information shared explicitly in confidence with expectation of no record

**Example of appropriate documentation:**
```markdown
## Personal Context
- Dealing with family health situation; may need flexibility next month
- Prefers morning meetings while managing this
```

**Example of inappropriate documentation:**
```markdown
## Personal Context
- Mother has stage 3 cancer, going through chemotherapy
- Spouse is stressed, they've been arguing
- Mentioned therapist recommended reducing work hours
```

### Sensitive Information Handling

When sensitive topics arise:

1. **Ask permission**: "Is it okay if I note that you might need schedule flexibility?"
2. **Keep it minimal**: Record only what's necessary for you to provide appropriate support
3. **Separate storage**: Consider keeping highly sensitive context separate from regular notes
4. **Time-limit**: Remove sensitive personal information once it's no longer relevant
5. **Assume discovery**: Write as if the notes could be read by HR or legal (because they could be)

### Notes as Manager's Private Tool

Your 1-on-1 notes are a management tool, not an official HR record. This distinction matters:

- **They are not shared with the employee** (unless you choose to share specific parts)
- **They are not performance documentation** (those go through official channels)
- **They should not be discoverable** in normal circumstances (keep them in your personal system)
- **They supplement, not replace** official performance records

However, be aware:
- In legal situations, any written records may be discoverable
- Don't write anything you couldn't defend if questioned
- Stick to facts and observations, not judgments or speculation

---

## 5. Organization Systems

### By Engineer (Recommended)

For managers using notes as a personal tool, organizing by person is typically most effective:

```
notes/
  one-on-ones/
    alex-chen.md
    jordan-smith.md
    taylor-wong.md
    sam-patel.md
```

**Advantages:**
- Natural mental model (you think about people, not dates)
- Easy to review history before each 1-on-1
- Patterns per person are immediately visible
- Scales well as entries accumulate

**Recommended file structure:**
```markdown
# Alex Chen - 1-on-1 Notes

## Quick Reference
- Role: Senior Engineer
- Start Date: 2023-06-15
- Current Focus: Platform reliability
- Career Goal: Staff Engineer path

## Active Action Items
- [ ] [Me] Check on conference budget
- [ ] [Alex] Draft RFC for caching proposal

---

## 2024-03-15
[Most recent first]

## 2024-03-01
[...]
```

### By Date

Date-based organization works better for:
- Managers who process 1-on-1s as a batch
- Situations requiring chronological audit trails
- Teams with high turnover

```
notes/
  one-on-ones/
    2024/
      2024-03-15-alex.md
      2024-03-15-jordan.md
      2024-03-14-taylor.md
```

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to see patterns per person
- More files to manage over time
- Requires more searching

### Searchability Requirements

Whatever system you choose, ensure:

1. **Full-text search**: You should be able to search across all notes
2. **Consistent naming**: Use the same terms for recurring topics
3. **Tags or markers**: Consider using consistent tags like `#promotion`, `#feedback`, `#action`

```markdown
## 2024-03-15 - Alex

Discussed promotion timeline #career #promotion
Gave feedback on code review tone #feedback
Need to follow up on training budget #action
```

**Search scenarios to support:**
- "What feedback have I given Alex about communication?"
- "Who mentioned burnout in the last 3 months?"
- "What action items do I have outstanding?"
- "When did I last discuss career goals with each person?"

## 6. Markdown and Plain Text Benefits

### Portability

Plain text files in markdown format are:
- **Not locked to any vendor**: No proprietary format to worry about
- **Easy to migrate**: Move between tools without data conversion
- **Backupable**: Standard file backup solutions work perfectly
- **Version controllable**: Can use git if desired (with appropriate privacy measures)

```bash
# Your notes work with any text editor
vim ~/notes/one-on-ones/alex.md
code ~/notes/one-on-ones/alex.md
open ~/notes/one-on-ones/alex.md  # Opens in default app
```

### Future-proof

Consider the lifespan of your notes:
- You might manage someone for 5+ years
- You'll likely change jobs and tools multiple times
- Note-taking apps come and go

Plain text markdown will be readable in 2034 just as easily as today. The same cannot be said for proprietary formats.

### Works with Existing Tools

Markdown notes integrate seamlessly with popular knowledge management tools:

**Obsidian:**
- Point vault at your notes directory
- Get backlinking, graph view, and search
- Notes remain plain files on disk

**Notion:**
- Import markdown files directly
- Maintains formatting and structure
- Can export back to markdown

**VS Code / Any Editor:**
- Syntax highlighting for markdown
- Search across files
- Extensions for task management

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Search all notes for "promotion"
grep -r "promotion" ~/notes/one-on-ones/

# Find all action items
grep -r "\[ \]" ~/notes/one-on-ones/

# Recent modifications
ls -lt ~/notes/one-on-ones/
```

## 7. Action Item Tracking

### Capturing Commitments

Every 1-on-1 generates commitments. Capture them explicitly:

```markdown
## Action Items

### Mine (Manager)
- [ ] Schedule meeting with VP about team expansion
- [ ] Share link to architecture decision template
- [ ] Look into conference sponsorship for StrangLoop

### Theirs (Engineer)
- [ ] Draft proposal for new CI/CD approach
- [ ] Schedule lunch with new team member
- [ ] Complete security training by March 30
```

**Tips for effective capture:**
- Write action items in active voice with clear ownership
- Include deadlines when they exist
- Be specific enough that you'll understand later
- Distinguish between hard commitments and "nice to have"

### Following Up

Action items are worthless without follow-up. Build a system:

**Before each 1-on-1:**
1. Review previous meeting's notes
2. Check status of your action items
3. Prepare to ask about their action items

**Aggregated action tracking:**
Consider maintaining a separate running list across all direct reports:

```markdown
# Outstanding Actions - Week of March 11

## For Me to Complete
- [ ] Alex: Conference budget question
- [ ] Jordan: Feedback on RFC draft
- [ ] Taylor: Promotion criteria document
- [ ] Sam: Introduction to Sarah from Platform team

## Waiting On
- [ ] Alex: CI/CD proposal (due March 15)
- [ ] Jordan: Onboarding doc updates
```

### Closing the Loop

Completing an action item has three states:
1. **Done**: Task completed as agreed
2. **Modified**: Scope changed or approach adjusted
3. **Dropped**: No longer needed (with explanation)

Always close the loop explicitly:

```markdown
## Previous Actions - Status

- [x] Schedule meeting with VP - Done, met March 10
- [~] Share architecture template - Modified: sent different resource that was better fit
- [-] Look into StrangLoop - Dropped: conference cancelled this year
```

This discipline builds trust. Your direct reports learn that when you say you'll do something, you either do it or explicitly communicate why not.

## Summary

Effective 1-on-1 note management combines:

1. **Consistent capture** - Take notes during or immediately after every meeting
2. **Appropriate structure** - Use templates that match your style while ensuring completeness
3. **Ethical awareness** - Document professionally, protect privacy, assume discovery
4. **Practical organization** - By person for personal tools, with good search capability
5. **Portable format** - Plain text markdown for longevity and flexibility
6. **Action discipline** - Capture, follow up, and close the loop on commitments

The goal is not perfect documentation but sustainable practice. A simple system you actually use beats an elaborate one you abandon. Start minimal, iterate based on what you find yourself needing, and let your note-taking practice evolve with your management style.
